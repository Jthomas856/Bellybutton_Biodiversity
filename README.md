# Bellybutton_Biodiversity

## Summary

For this challenge we are creating a dashboard to visualize bacteria data for each volunteer in the belly button bacteria study. The dashboard will dynamically display each volunteer's demographic data and bactiera sample data through a dropdown menu. We are using Javascript, Plotly, and D3 to create 3 charts to display bacteria data for each individual selected on the dashboard. The completed dashboard will be deployed to github pages.
